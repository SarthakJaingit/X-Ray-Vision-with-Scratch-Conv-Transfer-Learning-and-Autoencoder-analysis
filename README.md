# X-Ray Vision with Autoencoders, Transfer Learning, and Convolutional Layers

## Overview
Welcome to the **X-Ray Vision with Autoencoders, Transfer Learning, and Convolutional Layers** Project! In this project, we used a big dataset that contained X-rays for both Pneumonia and Normal chests. With this dataset we did the following objectives:

* Create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from Scatch
* Build an autoencoder from scratch to noisy up then denoise X-ray images
* Visualize the autoencoded output
* Then use transfer learning to classify X-rays
* Create a predicter function that can take a new x-ray and predict whether it is either 
  - Normal X-ray
  - Pneumonia X-ray  
* We then used the predictor for classifying unhealthy X-rays that had cancer or covid
* Finally, we used the predictor to classify the visualized images that were outputs to the Autoencoder.

**Note:** We made two predictors that each used a seperate model to classify
